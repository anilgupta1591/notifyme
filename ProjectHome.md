This is part of a notification concept, the core idea is to enable users to subscribe to content/ "transient widgets" they find valuable throughout their browsing experience. Thus enabling an ecosystem between the desktop and the web.

There are two main parts to this POC.

1. Notifications, that are enabled by keyboard input.
2. Notification aggregator.
